<a id="what-is-populace" class="anchor" href="#what-is-populace" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Populace?</h1>

<p>Populace is a town management plugin that works with <a href="https://github.com/Turqmelon/MelonEco">MelonEco</a>. I felt as though Towny was not only outdated, but difficult for new users to grasp, and thus Populace was born.</p>

<h1>
<a id="whats-different" class="anchor" href="#whats-different" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's different?</h1>

<p>Populace is driven mostly by a powerful ingame GUI. While commands are used for simple functions, most of the information and interaction is done through the interface.</p>

<h1>
<a id="what-does-it-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it do?</h1>

<p>As of now, Populace can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allow your players to create towns, claim land, delegate permissions, and invite residents</li>
<li>Provides a great anti-grief solution that protects against all known forms of griefing</li>
<li>Creates thriving economies in survival servers</li>
<li>Allows creation of unique shops using Ender Chests and an ingame UI <em>(Requires PopulaceMarket)</em>
</li>
<li>Allows establishment of sales tax to bring in more income for town mayors <em>(Requires PopulaceMarket)</em>
</li>
<li>Includes a powerful GUI for viewing town information and making management of complex tasks easy</li>
<li>Includes simple commands resulting in a very small learning curve for new players</li>
<li>Provides a complex and intuitive chat channel system, including town specific chat <em>(Requires PopulaceChat)</em>
</li>
<li>Includes an in-depth API (including events and direct hooking to Populace inner workings) for 3rd party developers</li>
<li>Cleans up chat by only showing join and quit messages to fellow town members <em>(Requires PopulaceJoin)</em>
</li>
<li>Adds town rank and town to player names in TAB and above heads. <em>(Requires PopulaceScoreboards)</em>
</li>
<li>Allows selling of town plots to residents</li>
<li>Jail system to allow town staff to punish naughty residents, while allowing the jailed individual to leave early by choosing to leave town</li>
<li><em>Much more...</em></li>
</ul>

<a id="town-leveling" class="anchor" href="#town-leveling" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Town Leveling</h1>

<p>As towns gain residents, they level up! THe higher the town level, the more land that can be claimed, and the more features that players unlock.</p>

<h1>
<a id="land" class="anchor" href="#land" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Land</h1>

<p>Towns can claim up to the amount of chunks listed for their level. If they need more land, they can purchase <strong>Bonus Land Chunks</strong>. Bonus Land Chunks trade off getting more land, at the cost of a higher daily upkeep. You can purchase Bonus Land Chunks up to the current level's cap. Example: <strong>Village</strong> can purchase up to <strong>96</strong> bonus land chunks, while <strong>Settlement</strong> can only buy <strong>16</strong>.</p>

<h1>
<a id="upkeep--taxes" class="anchor" href="#upkeep--taxes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upkeep &amp; Taxes</h1>

<p>Towns require a Daily Upkeep to stay alive. Every <strong>new day</strong> the daily upkeep is taken from the town bank. If a town can't afford the daily upkeep, it's deleted and the land is unclaimed.</p>

<p>In order to help pay for the Daily Upkeep, towns can impose 3 different taxes on residents</p>

<h2>
<a id="residency-tax" class="anchor" href="#residency-tax" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Residency Tax</h2>

<p>A base price that every resident of the town (except the Mayor) must pay. This amount doesn't change unless the Mayor does it.</p>

<h2>
<a id="plot-tax" class="anchor" href="#plot-tax" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plot Tax</h2>

<p>A plot tax is paid for every plot you own within a town. If a plot tax was <strong>30 Coins</strong>, and you own <strong>4 Plots</strong>, you would owe <em>120 Coins</em>* plus any <strong>Residency Tax</strong> chosen by the Mayor.</p>

<h2>
<a id="sales-tax-only-available-with-populacemarket" class="anchor" href="#sales-tax-only-available-with-populacemarket" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Sales Tax (Only available with PopulaceMarket)</h2>

<p>Sales Tax is not paid by residents, but by merchants. When an item is sold to a player, or bought from a player in Town, a percentage of the profit is taken as a sales tax. For instance, a Diamond Sword is sold for <strong>100 Coins</strong> and the town has a <strong>4%</strong> sales tax. The merchant would receive <strong>96 Coins</strong> from the sale, and the town bank would receive <strong>4 Coins</strong>.</p>

<p>If a resident cannot pay their taxes they are kicked from the town.</p>

<h2>
<a id="daily-upkeep" class="anchor" href="#daily-upkeep" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Daily Upkeep</h2>

<p>Daily upkeep is calculated after taxes are collected from residents. Please note, when a town is created they are given a <strong>grace period</strong>. During this time, no daily upkeep is required of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>For every claimed chunk, a cost is assessed. This varies based off the plot type, and the server you're playing on.</li>
<li>For every Resident in your town, a cost is assessed. The higher the rank of the resident, the more expensive.</li>
<li>For every 4 residents in your town, land cost is multiplied by +0.3%.</li>
<li>For every <strong>Bonus Land Chunk</strong> owned by your town, the Bonus Land cost price is assessed</li>
</ul>

<p>All those factors are added up to get your <strong>Daily Upkeep</strong>, then multiplied by the Town Level <strong>Upkeep Modifier</strong>. The Daily Upkeep can be seen at any time (as well as when it's next due) from the <strong>Economy</strong> tab of your <strong>/town</strong> menu.</p>
