I felt as though Towny was not only outdated, but difficult for new users to grasp, and this Populace was born.\r\n\r\n# What's different?\r\nPopulace is driven mostly by a powerful ingame GUI. While commands are used for simple functions, most of the information and interaction is done through the interface.\r\n\r\n# What does it do?\r\nAs of now, Populace can:\r\n* Allow your users to create towns, claim land, delegate permissions, and invite residents\r\n* Provides a great anti-grief solution that protects against all known forms of griefing\r\n* Creates thriving economies in survival servers\r\n* Allows creation of unique shops using Ender Chests and an ingame UI _(Requires PopulaceMarket)_\r\n* Allows establishment of sales tax to bring in more income for town mayors _(Requires PopulaceMarket)_\r\n* Includes a powerful GUI for viewing town information and making management of complex tasks easy\r\n* Includes a simple commands for a very small learning curve for players\r\n* Provides a complex and intuitive chat channel system, including town specific chat _(Requires PopulaceChat)_\r\n* Includes an in-depth API (including events and direct hooking to Populace interworkings) for 3rd party developers\r\n* Cleans up chat by only showing join and quit messages to fellow town members _(Requires PopulaceJoin)_\r\n* Allows selling of town plots to residents\r\n* Jail system to allow town staff to punish naughty residents, while allowing the jailed individual to leave early by choosing to leave town\r\n* _Much more..._\r\n\r\n# What are the commands?\r\nCommand | Description | Permission | Town Rank\r\n------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------\r\n/allow (Player) | Adds a player to the allow list for the plot you're standing in, giving them permission to bypass rank restrictions | populace.commands.allow | Plot Owner\r\n/claim (Radius) | Claims land for your town, or purchases a plot up for sale from the town | populace.commands.claim | Town Assistant/Resident\r\n/forsale (Price) | Puts the plot you're standing in up for sale | populace.commands.forsale | Town Assistant\r\n/giveplot (Player) | Invites a player to take ownership of the plot you're in | populace.commands.giveplot | Town Assistant\r\n/invite (Player) | Invites a player to town | populace.commands.invite | Town Manager\r\n/jail (Player) (Time) | Sends a player to the town jail | populace.commands.jail | Town Assistant\r\n/join (Town) | Joins a town, if you were invited or the town is open | populace.commands.join | --\r\n/map | Gives you a map of your town | populace.commands.map | Resident\r\n/newTown (Name) | Creates a new town | populace.commands.newtown | --\r\n/notforsale | Takes a plot of the market | populace.commands.notforsale | Town Assistant\r\n/plot | Shows info about the plot you're standing in | populace.commands.plot | --\r\n/populace | Shows plugin information and loaded modules | -- | --\r\n/resident (Player) | Shows resident information | populace.commands.resident | --\r\n/setjail | Sets the town jail to your location | populace.commands.setjail | Town Mayor\r\n/town (Town) | Shows info about a town | populace.commands.town | --\r\n/towns | Shows a list of towns on the server | populace.commands.towns | --\r\n/unclaim | Gives up your ownership of a plot, or unclaims land for the town | populace.commands.unclaim | Town Assistant/Plot Owner\r\n/unjail (Player) | Frees a player from jail | populace.commands.unjail | Town Assistant\r\n/visit (Town) | Warps you to the town spawn, if you have permission | populace.commands.visit | --\r\n/visualize | Shows a client-side border around the current plot | populace.commands.visualize | --\r\n\r\n# How do I use Populace?\r\n[Contact Me](mailto:business@turqmelon.com) and we can work something out. :) Thank you for your interest!",
