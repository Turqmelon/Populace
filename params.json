I felt as though Towny was not only outdated, but difficult for new users to grasp, and thus Populace was born.\r\n\r\n# What's different?\r\nPopulace is driven mostly by a powerful ingame GUI. While commands are used for simple functions, most of the information and interaction is done through the interface.\r\n\r\n# What does it do?\r\nAs of now, Populace can:\r\n* Allow your players to create towns, claim land, delegate permissions, and invite residents\r\n* Provides a great anti-grief solution that protects against all known forms of griefing\r\n* Creates thriving economies in survival servers\r\n* Allows creation of unique shops using Ender Chests and an ingame UI _(Requires PopulaceMarket)_\r\n* Allows establishment of sales tax to bring in more income for town mayors _(Requires PopulaceMarket)_\r\n* Includes a powerful GUI for viewing town information and making management of complex tasks easy\r\n* Includes simple commands resulting in a very small learning curve for new players\r\n* Provides a complex and intuitive chat channel system, including town specific chat _(Requires PopulaceChat)_\r\n* Includes an in-depth API (including events and direct hooking to Populace inner workings) for 3rd party developers\r\n* Cleans up chat by only showing join and quit messages to fellow town members _(Requires PopulaceJoin)_\r\n* Adds town rank and town to player names in TAB and above heads. _(Requires PopulaceScoreboards)_\r\n* Allows selling of town plots to residents\r\n* Jail system to allow town staff to punish naughty residents, while allowing the jailed individual to leave early by choosing to leave town\r\n* _Much more..._\r\n\r\n# Town Leveling\r\nAs towns gain residents, they level up! THe higher the town level, the more land that can be claimed, and the more features that players unlock.\r\n\r\nLevel | Residents Required | Upkeep Modifier | Max Land\r\n----- | ------------------ | --------------- | --------\r\nSettlement | 1 | 1.0x | 16 Chunks\r\nHamlet | 2 | 1.0x | 32 Chunks\r\nVillage | 6 | 1.0x | 96 Chunks\r\nTown | 10 | 1.0x | 160 Chunks\r\nLarge Town | 15 | 1.1x | 224 Chunks\r\nCity | 25 | 1.2x | 320 Chunks\r\nLarge City | 30 | 1.3x | 384 Chunks\r\nMetropolis | 50 | 1.5x | 448 Chunks\r\n\r\n# Land\r\nTowns can claim up to the amount of chunks listed for their level. If they need more land, they can purchase **Bonus Land Chunks**. Bonus Land Chunks trade off getting more land, at the cost of a higher daily upkeep. You can purchase Bonus Land Chunks up to the current level's cap. Example: **Village** can purchase up to **96** bonus land chunks, while **Settlement** can only buy **16**.\r\n\r\n# Upkeep & Taxes\r\nTowns require a Daily Upkeep to stay alive. Every **new day** the daily upkeep is taken from the town bank. If a town can't afford the daily upkeep, it's deleted and the land is unclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn order to help pay for the Daily Upkeep, towns can impose 3 different taxes on residents\r\n\r\n## Residency Tax\r\nA base price that every resident of the town (except the Mayor) must pay. This amount doesn't change unless the Mayor does it.\r\n\r\n## Plot Tax\r\nA plot tax is paid for every plot you own within a town. If a plot tax was **30 Coins**, and you own **4 Plots**, you would owe *120 Coins** plus any **Residency Tax** chosen by the Mayor.\r\n\r\n## Sales Tax (Only available with PopulaceMarket)\r\nSales Tax is not paid by residents, but by merchants. When an item is sold to a player, or bought from a player in Town, a percentage of the profit is taken as a sales tax. For instance, a Diamond Sword is sold for **100 Coins** and the town has a **4%** sales tax. The merchant would receive **96 Coins** from the sale, and the town bank would receive **4 Coins**.\r\n\r\nIf a resident cannot pay their taxes they are kicked from the town.\r\n\r\n## Daily Upkeep\r\nDaily upkeep is calculated after taxes are collected from residents. Please note, when a town is created they are given a **grace period**. During this time, no daily upkeep is required of them.\r\n\r\n* For every claimed chunk, a cost is assessed. This varies based off the plot type, and the server you're playing on.\r\n* For every Resident in your town, a cost is assessed. The higher the rank of the resident, the more expensive.\r\n* For every 4 residents in your town, land cost is multiplied by +0.3%.\r\n* For every **Bonus Land Chunk** owned by your town, the Bonus Land cost price is assessed\r\n\r\nAll those factors are added up to get your **Daily Upkeep**, then multiplied by the Town Level **Upkeep Modifier**. The Daily Upkeep can be seen at any time (as well as when it's next due) from the **Economy** tab of your **/town** menu.\r\n\r\n# What are the commands?\r\nCommand | Description | Permission | Town Rank\r\n------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------\r\n/allow (Player) | Adds a player to the allow list for the plot you're standing in, giving them permission to bypass rank restrictions | populace.commands.allow | Plot Owner\r\n/claim (Radius) | Claims land for your town, or purchases a plot up for sale from the town | populace.commands.claim | Town Assistant/Resident\r\n/forsale (Price) | Puts the plot you're standing in up for sale | populace.commands.forsale | Town Assistant\r\n/giveplot (Player) | Invites a player to take ownership of the plot you're in | populace.commands.giveplot | Town Assistant\r\n/invite (Player) | Invites a player to town | populace.commands.invite | Town Manager\r\n/jail (Player) (Time) | Sends a player to the town jail | populace.commands.jail | Town Assistant\r\n/join (Town) | Joins a town, if you were invited or the town is open | populace.commands.join | --\r\n/map | Gives you a map of your town | populace.commands.map | Resident\r\n/newTown (Name) | Creates a new town | populace.commands.newtown | --\r\n/notforsale | Takes a plot of the market | populace.commands.notforsale | Town Assistant\r\n/plot | Shows info about the plot you're standing in | populace.commands.plot | --\r\n/populace | Shows plugin information and loaded modules | -- | --\r\n/resident (Player) | Shows resident information | populace.commands.resident | --\r\n/setjail | Sets the town jail to your location | populace.commands.setjail | Town Mayor\r\n/town (Town) | Shows info about a town | populace.commands.town | --\r\n/towns | Shows a list of towns on the server | populace.commands.towns | --\r\n/unclaim | Gives up your ownership of a plot, or unclaims land for the town | populace.commands.unclaim | Town Assistant/Plot Owner\r\n/unjail (Player) | Frees a player from jail | populace.commands.unjail | Town Assistant\r\n/visit (Town) | Warps you to the town spawn, if you have permission | populace.commands.visit | --\r\n/visualize | Shows a client-side border around the current plot | populace.commands.visualize | --\r\n\r\n# Can I see screenshots?\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/0U0i3z1J19003C090H0v/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-18%20at%2012.39.38%20PM.png?v=fcfd0789)\r\n_Permission management, for selecting which ranks can do what._\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3u372T2U102b0I0O3E2w/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-19%20at%205.40.32%20PM.png?v=bb040110)\r\n_Economy tab, for viewing upkeep and taxation info._\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3U3Y013Z0B0j3q2h0E3Q/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-19%20at%205.37.22%20PM.png?v=781fc76a)\r\n_General town information._\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3N1K331n1O0H3m0d0U28/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-19%20at%209.11.40%20PM.png?v=a39869ab)\r\n_Custom mapping system._\r\n\r\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/463I261o1Q3C1B090P1j/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-26%20at%2012.37.12%20PM.png?v=d5a0eba5)\r\n_Chat format example._\r\n\r\n# How do I use Populace?\r\n[Contact Me](mailto:business@turqmelon.com) and we can work something out. :) Thank you for your interest!",
